## Background
A bank manager was concerned about the increasing number of customers who were abandoning their credit card services. 
Bank X has 10271 customers of which 8500 or 84% are existing customers and 1627 or 16% are churn customers. 
Bank X wants to reduce customer churn by analysing the data they have and finding proactive steps to increase their customers and revenue.
 
 `Main Goals`
 - Investigating customer churn using exploratory data analysis with SQL.
 - Create dashboards to learn more about the impact of customer churn.

`Insight`
- In terms of gender, the number of churned customers is 930. Most of the customers are women.
- Based on marital status, most customers are married and single, and most churned are married and single.
- Students and graduates are the biggest customers of Bank X. Most of the churning customers are graduates, students and unknown education.
- Most customers are in their forties and fifties, both in terms of existing customers and customer churn.
- Based on income, most customers have an income of less than $400,000 and the highest income is around$120,000.
- The lower the income, the higher the churn rate.
- Both existing and churning customers have $44,000,000 in transactions.
  The average transaction from existing customers is $4655 and the average churn is $3095.

### `Conclusion`
Income and the number of times the bank contacts customers have an impact on customer churn. 
The lower the income, the higher the churn. The less the bank contacts the customer, the more the customer will churn.

### `Recommendation`
- Closely monitor what customers buy, how they buy, and what they do with your products.
- Customer retention strategies, such as sending targeted messages via email or Whatsapp to customers who are about
to leave, could be just the sign they need to stay with your company. It doesn't always have to be a big deal,
sometimes just letting them know you still care is enough.
